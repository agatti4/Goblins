Here is my final project I made for Introduction to Python.
<ul>
  <li>The goal of the game is to try and get to 1000 points before time runs out.<li>
  You move with the left and right arrow keys and shoot with spacebar.
  To get points you have to shoot the green objects.
  You have 60 seconds.
  It uses graphics and all the stuff I learned throughout the semester to achieve this final game.
</ul>
Here is the layouts:

This project took me a long time, but I'm glad with how it came out.

To run: I use terminal, but use any python IDE to run this.
